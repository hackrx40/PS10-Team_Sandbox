2. Gather evidence: Collect all relevant documents, records, and any other evidence that supports your case. This may include contracts, photographs, emails, witness statements, or any other relevant information.

3. Draft the complaint: Work with your lawyer to draft a complaint, which outlines your legal claims, the facts of the case, and the relief you are seeking. This document sets the foundation for your case.

4. File the complaint: Once the complaint is ready, it needs to be filed with the appropriate court. Visit the court clerk's office or check their website to understand the filing requirements, including any filing fees and specific forms needed. Ensure you follow all necessary procedures and meet all deadlines.

5. Serve the defendant: After filing the complaint, you must serve a copy of the complaint to the opposing party, known as the defendant. This can usually be done through certified mail, hand delivery by a process server, or in some cases, through electronic means, depending on the court's rules.

6. Defendant's response: The defendant has a certain period of time, specified by law, to respond to your complaint. They may file an answer, addressing each allegation and presenting their defense. Alternatively, they may file a motion to dismiss or challenge the complaint.

7. Discovery process: Both parties exchange information and evidence through the discovery process. This may involve depositions, written interrogatories, requests for documents, and other legal procedures to uncover relevant facts and information.

8. Settlement negotiations or trial preparation: Depending on the circumstances, you may explore settlement negotiations with the defendant to resolve the case outside of court. If a settlement cannot be reached, your lawyer will prepare for trial, including gathering additional evidence, identifying key witnesses, and developing a trial strategy.

9. Trial and judgment: If your case goes to trial, you will present your case to a judge or jury, who will then decide the outcome. After both sides present their arguments and evidence, a judgment will be issued, determining the winner of the case and any remedies or damages awarded.
